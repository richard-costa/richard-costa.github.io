### About Me

I'm a Data Scientist working for [Atento](https://atento.com/en/). Data Science is a huge field, a whole landscape to be explored, and I'm interested in much of what's going on in this field. 

I'm also a Ph.D. student in Physics at [Federal University of ABC](https://www.ufabc.edu.br/en/) with the [Quantum Information Group](https://www.quantumufabc.org/). My master's thesis was on a very niche subject, concerning the calculation of some thermodynamic quantities for a specific kind of fermionic field. 

My resume can be found here:
