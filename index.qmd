# About Me

I'm Richard. I work as a Data Scientist for a startup and I'm also a Ph.D. student in Physics at [Federal University of ABC](https://www.ufabc.edu.br/en/) at the [Quantum Information Group](https://www.quantumufabc.org/). For a quick overview of my education and professional experience you can check my cv [here](cv.qmd).
I also do some digital painting from time to time. Here's my latest artwork:
