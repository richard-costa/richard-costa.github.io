I also hold a B.Sc and a M.Sc. in Physics.\nBeyond tech, I’m an amateur digital artist. I create digital paintings using krita, and you can find my artwork on my Instagram profile below.\nYou can access my résumé here:\nenglish | português label"

In my case I wanted two things: to test the Cosmic desktop environment and add a separate user for family and friends so they have a separate and friendly environment to use my computer. Along the way I found out that I could use some nice themes for the sddm display manager and could logout from the menu in omarchy."

    "text": "This is a review of important concepts in quantum mechanics, aimed at the reader who has already taken a first course on quantum mechanics.\n\n\nQuantum States\nStates are represented by vectors in a Hilbert space. A wavefunction \\(\\psi\\) is a solution to the Schrödinger equation. It also represents the components of a state vector \\(\\Psi\\). If the wavefunction depends on the position \\(\\mathbf{r}\\), that is, \\(\\psi = \\psi(\\mathbf{r})\\), then it is a solution to the Schrödinger equation in position space components of \\(\\Psi\\) in an infinite dimension along the direction corresponding to a definite value \\(\\mathbf{r}\\) of the position. The wavefunction is also a type of projection. The state vector \\(\\Psi\\) is given by\n\\[\n| \\Psi \\rangle = \\int d^{3} \\mathbf{r} | \\mathbf{r} \\rangle \\langle \\mathbf{r} | \\Psi \\rangle\n\\tag{1}\\]\nand this component in terms of Dirac notation is given by\n\\[\n\\langle  \\mathbf{r}  | \\Psi \\rangle = \\psi (\\mathbf{r}).\n\\] Positions are part of a continuous set, so at first: \\(\\mathbf{r} \\in [-\\infty, \\infty ]\\). Since each component in the state vector space is associated to a value of the position vector, we have infinite directions in this space and each direction is labeled by \\(\\mathbf{r}\\).\nThe state vector in the form (1) is just one of the possible representations. In particular, we used the position representation. We can use another system variable such as the momentum. In this case, we have\n\\[\n\\langle \\mathbf{p} | \\Psi \\rangle = \\phi ( \\mathbf{p}),\n\\]\n\n\nStationary States\n\n\nSuggested Reading\n\nWeinberg, S., 2015. Lectures on quantum mechanics.
