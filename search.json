Some solutions I stumbled upon would only allow me to see the current month, and I wanted to be able to navigate between months and years. After some search, I decided to go with yad. To use it properly I’d also need to create a script to run the calendar widget and set an icon in my waybar for it. So that’s what I did.\n\nbasic calendar\nFirst, install yad:\nsudo pacman -Syu\nsudo pacman -S yad\nThen, create a file ~/.config/waybar/scripts/calendar.sh. The simplest way to make the calendar work is just by writing:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nyad --calendar\nMake the file executable by running\nchmod +x ~/.config/waybar/scripts/calendar.sh\nNow, add the script path to the waybar config file at ~/.config/waybar/config.jsonc:\n\"custom/calendar\": {\n  \"format\": \"\",\n  \"tooltip\": false,\n  \"on-click\": \"~/.config/waybar/scripts/calendar.sh\"\n}\nIn the config file there is an entry called ‘modules-right’:\n  \"modules-right\": [\n    \"group/tray-expander\",\n    \"bluetooth\",\n    \"network\",\n    \"pulseaudio\",\n    \"cpu\",\n    \"battery\"\n  ]\nAdd your calendar to this section:\n  \"modules-right\": [\n    \"group/tray-expander\",\n    \"custom/calendar\",\n    \"bluetooth\",\n    \"network\",\n    \"pulseaudio\",\n    \"cpu\",\n    \"battery\"\n  ],\nIn ~/.config/waybar/styles.css add\n#custom-calendar {\n  min-width: 12px;\n  margin: 0 18px;\n}\nso that the calendar icon to add some space between the calendar icon and the next icon. Adjust margin as you see fit. Finally, run\npkill waybar && waybar &\n\n\nsome more tweaks\nIf you want to add a keybinding to the calendar (mine is SUPER + C) go to ~/.config/hypr/bindings.conf and add\nbindd = SUPER, C, Calendar, exec, ~/.config/waybar/scripts/calendar.sh\nI also removed buttons (‘ok’ and ‘cancel’), set some size to the calendar, and gave it a name so that I could reference in hyprland configuration later::\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\n# if a YAD calendar titled \"Calendar\" is already running, kill it\nif pgrep -f 'yad --calendar --title=Calendar' &gt;/dev/null; then\n  pkill -f 'yad --calendar --title=Calendar'\n  exit 0\nfi\n\n# otherwise, open a new calendar (toggle on)\nyad --calendar \\\n    --title=\"Calendar\" \\\n    --width=320 \\\n    --height=260 \\\n    --no-buttons \nThe first bit is to ensure that if you click again it won’t open up another window (since we don’t have buttons now to close the window. To make it appear in the center of the screen go to ~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf and add\n# float the YAD calendar popup\nwindowrulev2 = float, class:^(?i:yad)$, title:^(Calendar)$\n\n# center it on the monitor\nwindowrulev2 = center, class:^(?i:yad)$, title:^(Calendar)$\nIt should like like this:\n\n\n\ncalendar\n\n\nWe could also add the calendar to the menu, but I’ll leave that for later."

    "text": "DRAFT\nThis is a review of important concepts in quantum mechanics, aimed at the reader who has already taken a first course on quantum mechanics.\n\n\nQuantum States\nStates are represented by vectors in a Hilbert space. A wavefunction \\(\\psi\\) is a solution to the Schrödinger equation. It also represents the components of a state vector \\(\\Psi\\). If the wavefunction depends on the position \\(\\mathbf{r}\\), that is, \\(\\psi = \\psi(\\mathbf{r})\\), then it is a solution to the Schrödinger equation in position space components of \\(\\Psi\\) in an infinite dimension along the direction corresponding to a definite value \\(\\mathbf{r}\\) of the position. The wavefunction is also a type of projection. The state vector \\(\\Psi\\) is given by\n\\[\n| \\Psi \\rangle = \\int d^{3} \\mathbf{r} | \\mathbf{r} \\rangle \\langle \\mathbf{r} | \\Psi \\rangle\n\\tag{1}\\]\nand this component in terms of Dirac notation is given by\n\\[\n\\langle  \\mathbf{r}  | \\Psi \\rangle = \\psi (\\mathbf{r}).\n\\] Positions are part of a continuous set, so at first: \\(\\mathbf{r} \\in [-\\infty, \\infty ]\\). Since each component in the state vector space is associated to a value of the position vector, we have infinite directions in this space and each direction is labeled by \\(\\mathbf{r}\\).\nThe state vector in the form (1) is just one of the possible representations. In particular, we used the position representation. We can use another system variable such as the momentum. In this case, we have\n\\[\n\\langle \\mathbf{p} | \\Psi \\rangle = \\phi ( \\mathbf{p}),\n\\]\n\n\nStationary States\n\n\nSuggested Reading\n\nWeinberg, S., 2015. Lectures on quantum mechanics.

    "text": "This website uses quarto as its publishing and writing platform. It seems the package for installing quarto on arch-linux is not maintained at this time. We are left then with downloading the tarball file and installing it. After downloading the file from https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/ we should extract the contents of it and in my case I needed to create a symlink to be able to use it in the terminal, so basically for the 1.8.26 version:\ncd ~/Downloads\ntar -xvzf quarto-1.8.26-linux-amd64.tar.gz\nsudo mv quarto-1.8.26 /opt/quarto\nsudo ln -sf /opt/quarto/bin/quarto /usr/local/bin/quarto\nThat’s it. However, since I didn’t install it via a package manager I created a script in /usr/local/bin/update-quarto to update it:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\nset -e\n\nINSTALL_DIR=\"/opt/quarto\"\nBIN_LINK=\"/usr/local/bin/quarto\"\n\necho \"removing old quarto installation...\"\nsudo rm -rf \"$INSTALL_DIR\"\n\necho \"downloading latest quarto release...\"\ncd /tmp\nLATEST_URL=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/releases/latest \\\n  | grep browser_download_url \\\n  | grep linux-amd64.tar.gz \\\n  | cut -d '\"' -f 4)\n\ncurl -sSL \"$LATEST_URL\" -o quarto.tar.gz\n\necho \"extracting...\"\ntar -xzf quarto.tar.gz\nEXTRACTED_DIR=$(tar -tf quarto.tar.gz | head -1 | cut -f1 -d\"/\")\n\necho \"installing to $INSTALL_DIR...\"\nsudo mv \"$EXTRACTED_DIR\" \"$INSTALL_DIR\"\nsudo ln -sf \"$INSTALL_DIR/bin/quarto\" \"$BIN_LINK\"\n\necho \"cleaning up...\"\nrm -f quarto.tar.gz\n\necho \"done. installed $(/usr/local/bin/quarto --version)\"\nAnd then in the terminal just run update-quarto.
